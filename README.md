# TF2 VScript "Subteam" Manager.

This Library implements custom team logic to allow team partitioning;

e.g. dividing RED (or BLU, or both, depends on your needs) into multiple "sub-teams".

This allows custom game modes to have more than two teams at a given time.

It is advised you go through the script to learn how it functions and how it can be configured.
